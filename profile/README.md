# 🌸 Welcome to Serlith Network 🌸
This is a Minecraft Network with a focus on making things differently. \
We aim to offer well-known mini-games as they're now while also updating to newer versions those that will actually benefit from updating.

## 🔨 Purpose
Repositories found here exist for transparency reasons. \
Tools that we use and don't represent a risk being public will be available for review by anyone. \
Plugins that won't/can't be available are:
* Core plugins
* Critical plugins
* Private forks with closed-source licenses

## 🗓️ Update Schedule
There's no fixed update schedule. \
Updates to our software will come when needed.

## 📡 API
Planned for the future, no ETA at the moment.
